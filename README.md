I want to make modifications to the GUI by adding: 
Player Lives Count
Background Music
One new weapon 

Player Lives Count will keep track of their lives. They lose one life if they lose their shield and gain a life if they collect a shield. The game will restart if they die and have no more lives. 

Background music is to make the game more lively.

The new weapon I would like to add includes giving the player the ability to shoot faster and have continuous damage, similar to a laser.
